## Introduction

For RL to work, we need sufficiently many questions at the correct difficulty level. The
issue is that most difficult problems are very sparse and lack training data. LADDER
solves this by getting the LLM to generate synthetic easier variants of the initial question
in a treelike structure, allowing the model to use RL to bootstrap itself toward solving
harder problems
